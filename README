Unicorn 0.1.1-hpc
-----------------

Background:

Unicorn an attempt to unify continuum mechanics models and solvers in
the FEniCS (www.fenicsproject.org) project. We define a fundamental
model for conservation laws (mass, momentum, energy) which is fixed
and then allow additional constitutive models for stress-strain
relations. The total model is then solved using the G2 (General
Galerkin) method which is based on FEM and duality-based adaptivity.

Dependencies:

Unicorn is part of a chain of components in FEniCS like so:

FIAT - UFC - FFC - DOLFIN - Unicorn

The package dependencies of Unicorn  are:

    * ufc (1.1)
    * ffc (0.5.1)
    * dolfin (0.8.1-hpc)

Source code structure:

Unicorn is divided into two parts: a library (exists under src/) and
example solvers (exists under ucsolver/), which uses the library to
solve the equations of continuum mechanics using G2. There currently
exists only one variant of ucsolver for the hpc branch (icns -
Incompressible Navier-Stokes)

There also exists test programs (under test/) which are used for
development purposes, i.e. for testing various parts of the library or
new ideas. These are not guaranteed to work but could be interesting
to study.

Development structure:

Unicorn is openly developed as Free Software. The source code is
version controlled in the Mercurial system in a public repository:

https://launchpad.net/unicorn/hpc

Testing:

To verify correct installation and functionality of Unicorn, follow these steps:

1. $ source local.sh (Configure and setup environment variables)
2. make install (Compile and install)
3. cd ucsolver/icns/cube
4. make
5. mpirun -np 8 ./cube -p parameters -m mesh.xml 1> log1 2> log2 &
(increase or decrease "8" to match the number of cores in your system)

The test corresponds to turbulent flow around a cube described in the
chapter "Turbulent Flow and Fluid-Structure Interaction" in the book "Automated Scientific Computing".
